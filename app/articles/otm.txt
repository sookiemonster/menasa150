   <h3>Push & Pull Factors</h3>
   
   <p>In coastal cities, rapid technological change left certain old crafts no longer needed in the new economy. One example of this stratification of professions is a list published in 1880–1900 by the Ottoman government, in which old practices decreased in number while new practices related to technology, specifically transportation, increased. In addition to unemployment, specific professions were under attack. The destruction of vineyards by an insect named Phylloxera caused a great dip in wine production and exportation; the opening of the Suez Canal shifted a large amount of commerce to Egypt, leaving little opportunity for Ottoman traders; and silkworm disease that killed off worms forced silk farmers to import worms from France. Policies such as mandatory military service for Muslims also turned some to the path of immigration.</p>

   <p>Domestic conflicts and oppression are essential contributors to immigration. Following conflicts with the Druze and a massacre in 1860 in which over 10,000 Christians were killed, Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate established a new administrative government in 1861 as a place for Maronite Christians. Although it established a Christian governorship for the region, it also had an adversarial effect on the local economy. The decision to cut off the administrative government from other parts of the Ottoman Empire effectively limited economic opportunity for Maronites. Although there was oppression against Christians in the Ottoman empire, socioeconomic reasons were the primary push factor, though many publications emphasized “on such factors as the Druze revolt…” (Karpat, 1985).</p>
   <p>As for reasons to go to the United States, employment opportunities and higher wages were the main attractions. Initially, factories in the U.S. took in many Syrian immigrants; later, more turned to the business of peddling. Since about one third of the migrants did eventually return to their homeland, those early immigrant pioneers arrived home with tales of rags to riches, becoming another pull factor.</p>
