   <p>With this growing demand for ethnic resources from an increasingly large population, some MENASA immigrants began to establish more communities and businesses that sought to quench these desires. Weekly newspapers kept the growing community up-to-date on current happenings in their home countries, and restaurants and grocery stores dished out nostalgic cuisines and ingredients. The supply slowly started to address the demand, and the culture of MENASA immigrants flourished within their new environment, reinforcing their undeniable, steadily growing presence in New York.</p>
   <p>However, not all MENASA immigrants tried to announce their presence; some groups tried to assimilate and become “culturally invisible” to avoid racial discrimination. Specifically, in comparison to immigrants from South Asia, a non-insignificant number of Middle eastern immigrants considered and branded themselves as white. </p>
   <h3>India Abroad</h3>
   <p>One of the more prominent newspapers that directly linked immigrants in New York to their mother countries back in the Eastern Hemisphere, was a weekly newspaper called India Abroad. Founded in 1970 by Gopal Raju in New York, India Abroad did not exclusively focus on issues that were occurring in India; it also focused on South-Asian-related politics within both New York and across the United States, highlighting events that directly impacted the MENASA community ("Gopal Raju," 2008)</p>

   <p>Its coverage ranged from reporting on hate crimes against MENASA people ("2 Beat Musician," 1984) to vocalizing concerns from South Asian associations such as The South Asian Action and Advocacy Collective and South Asian Lesbian and Gay Association (Joshi, 2001). In addition to highlighting social issues, India Abroad also involved itself in the political realm, sometimes critiquing legislation and politics (Chugani & Nayar, 1991). This emphasized its commitment to raising political awareness and encouraging political action; India Abroad empowered its readers to actively participate in the political process and fight against repressive laws and take an active stance within the political sphere, regardless of whether immigrants were in New York or other parts of the world. </p>
   <p>This strongly emphasizes the permanence and significance of their presence within New York. For this newspaper to be as successful and influential as it was, there evidently had to have been an immense population of South Asians who wanted to hear about news regarding their home countries and fellow immigrants. Thus, thanks to this wide variety of topics as well as the coverage across a vast geographical scope, MENASA groups were able to maintain this sense of interconnectedness although many of them were dispersed across just New York and the world. </p>
   <p class="note">* It stands to mention, however, that while India Abroad was quite a widespread and influential organization during its time, unfortunately, the newspaper has stopped publishing articles. Although it was sold to Rediff in 2001 (Rediff, 2008), its website has since shut down, and few articles are available as archives from various other sources. </p>

   <h3>Little Armenia, Little India</h3>
   <p>In New York, as MENASA presence grew, a concentration of primarily South Asian businesses, restaurants, shops, and cultural institutions also began to form, called Little India. It served as a cultural hub where immigrants and visitors alike could experience the flavors, traditions, and customs of South Asia, ultimately adding to a greater sense of community and sustaining immigrants’ connection to their home countries. In the same vein, this development helped preserve and emphasize their cultural presence within such a new environment, where ethnic resources like these hadn’t initially been available or accessible.</p>

   <p>It stands to mention, however, that while nowadays, in the context of New York City, Little India refers to a singular neighborhood situated within the boundaries of Queens, over the course of NYC’s history, there were multiple versions of Little India, each having a different location. The first Little India sprung up in Manhattan, around Lexington Avenue and 28th Street; the latter, and more widely known, Little India was established around 74th Street in Jackson Heights, Queens (Khandelwal, 2018).</p>
   <p>Manhattan’s version of Little India has, albeit informally, rebranded itself multiple times. At its inception, this small handful of businesses and restaurants weren’t referred to as Little India; they were originally part of Little Armenia (Howe, 1985; Patel, 2014). Decades later it became Little India, and went on to become known as Curry Hill as of currently. That said, the shopping area was quite popular, hence why some businesses have stood the test of time and persisted to this day, such as Turkish immigrant Kerope Kalustyan’s aptly named grocery store, Kalyustan’s (Nadelson, 2021; Khandelwal, 2018). However, many businesses weren’t as lucky. Due to heightened rent and competition with the plethora of businesses opening in Queens, many businesses in what was Manhattan’s Little India were forced to close (Howe, 1985). Those competing businesses were the very ones that would soon go on to form the next Little India. </p>
