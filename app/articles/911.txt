   <p>The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, are widely recognized as a defining moment in American history. The attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people and injured thousands more, were perpetrated by a group of Islamist extremists affiliated with Al-Qaeda, a militant group based in the Middle East. The attacks were a shock to the nation and the world, and they prompted an immediate response from the US government, including the launch of military operations in Afghanistan and the enactment of a series of laws and policies aimed at enhancing national security and preventing future attacks.</p>
   <p>One of the key impacts of 9/11 was its effect on the perception and presence of immigrants in the United States, particularly those from MENASA regions. Before 9/11, many MENASA immigrants had come to the United States for education, work, or family reunification, contributing immensely to the US economy and society in various ways. However, after 9/11, MENASA immigrants became the target of suspicion, fear, and discrimination, as they were falsely associated with the attackers and labeled as potential terrorists. This negative perception had a significant impact on the lives and livelihoods of MENASA immigrants, affecting their ability to find work, obtain visas, travel freely, and express their cultural and religious identity. Moreover, the policies and practices implemented by the US government in the aftermath of 9/11 had a profound impact on the legal status and rights of MENASA immigrants, as well as on their relationship with their communities and the broader American society.</p>
   <p>In the aftermath of the attacks, there was a rise in anti-Muslim and anti-Arab sentiment, which led to discriminatory policies and increased surveillance of these communities. This resulted in a significant impact on the social and cultural lives of MENASA immigrants and their communities in the United States. One of the primary effects of 9/11 on MENASA immigrants was the heightened sense of fear and insecurity they experienced in their daily lives. In addition, there was a widespread perception that all Muslims were potential terrorists, and this perception was often extended to those of MENASA descent, regardless of their religion or background, as a result of the group of terrorists identifying as Muslim and claiming to act in the name of Islam (despite not carrying out any Islamic principles). As a result, many MENASA immigrants experienced increased surveillance, racial profiling, and discrimination in various areas of their lives, including employment, housing, and travel. For instance, in the wake of 9/11, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) began to increasingly target Arab and Muslim-looking passengers for additional searches and questioning in airports. This triggered the coining of the term, “Flying while Muslim,” which encapsulates the experiences of innocent Middle Eastern and Muslim passengers who were extensively questioned while trying to board airplanes (Dubosh et al., 2015). </p>
   <p>Another significant effect of 9/11 on MENASA immigrants was the impact on their cultural and social identities. The attacks led to a heightened sense of patriotism and nationalism in the United States, which often manifested as a rejection of anything perceived as foreign or un-American. This had an impact on the cultural identities of MENASA immigrants, who often felt that their cultures were being rejected or suppressed in favor of a more homogenized American identity. Many MENASA immigrants reported feeling alienated from their communities and struggled to maintain a sense of cultural identity in the face of discrimination and social isolation. Prior to 9/11, Arab Americans were not recognized as a racial/ ethnic group, however, they evolved from invisible to “glaringly conspicuous” even if the obviousness was unwelcomed. The lack of welcome with this new visibility was due to the harmful motivations of law and intelligence agencies and was instead met with derision and disapproval (Salaita 2005). Additionally, the aftermath of 9/11 had an impact on the relationships between MENASA immigrants and their non-MENASA neighbors. Moreover, there was a notable increase in hate crimes and xenophobic attacks against MENASA individuals, and this led to a sense of fear and mistrust between communities, which had a drastic impact on the social interactions between individuals of different ethnicities and religious backgrounds, leading to a sense of isolation and division. An FBI report from 2002 reported a 1,600 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes between 2000 and 2001— from a recorded 28 hate incidents in 2000 to an influx of 481 incidents in 2001. Additionally, according to the New York City Police Department (NYPD), there were 117 recorded incidents of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the city alone from September 11, 2001, to March 2002. However, the increase in hate crimes was not limited to Muslims but extended to anti-Arab sentiments (Disha et al., 2011). </p>
