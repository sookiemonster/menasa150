   <h3>Settlement</h3>
   <p>Initially, many not-well-off migrants from the Greater Syria region sought to return home after earning enough; about one-third of the migrants did return. At the end of the 1800s, more professionals and college-educated people started arriving in the U.S. Between 1880 and 1910 was the period thought of as the Pioneer period," where the peddling business flourished. Mostly men dominated the immigration wave, though about 70 percent of female immigrants engaged in peddling. In the 1910–1930 period, settlement became more common. The chain migration of women and children started to occur. Arab immigrants from other parts of Mesopotamia also began to arrive. There was a move away from peddling to business ownership, as it was more stable. As older immigrants began having children, their children quickly adopted the American lifestyle. Younger generations tend to embrace American values with greater ease and show even more embarrassment for their illiterate parents. The immigration wave decreased dramatically due to the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924, where Asian immigration was halted. The 1924 Act controlled immigration and established quotas set based on national origins, which effectively promoted European migration while drastically limiting regions that were considered part of Asia. It was not until the HartCeller Act of 1965 that the quote system based on national origins was abolished. Overall, from 1899 to 1924, there were a total of 77,330 Syrian immigrants who arrived.</p>

         “Socially, the deep satisfaction with America which accompanied their peddling success redirected their goals from those of temporary migrants to permanent citizens.” -Naff (1985)

   <p>Peddling was a central part of the Arab-American experience. After having children, Syrian immigrants generally abandoned the idea of returning to Syria and assimilated into American culture. Syrian peddlers often fell victim to orientalist stereotypes such as "exotic” or “manipulative." As it satisfied Syrian immigrants’ sense of individuality and entrepreneurial ambition (Naff, 1985).</p>
   <h3>Race</h3>
   <p>Initially, immigrants from Greater Syria were not separated from other Asians. For example, Armenianswere initially grouped into "Other Asians." Statistics from Turkey only began in the late 1800s. The Ottoman Empire kept few records of emigrants, with it being technically forbidden by the Ottoman government. In addition, many came through undocumented or used non-Ottoman records, so there was little documentation on them. </p>
   <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, naturalization was only granted to whites and people of African descent. Compared to other nations in the Americas, such as Brazil, that had a much more complex racial build-up, the United States had a duality of race relations—white and black. Due to such duality, it is difficult to classify people of other backgrounds. In the case of Middle Eastern immigrants, some petitioned to be considered "white," as it was associated with privileges such as naturalization rights, though they were largely considered by European Americans to be somewhere between black and Asian. In the immigration law of 1924, it stated that naturalization rights are only limited to "free white persons, aliens of African nativity, and persons of African descent." In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Syrians, Turks, Armenians, and Persians were considered white by the US government and were granted naturalization rights despite being non-Europeans. Even with darker, olive-colored skin and dark eyes, Syrian immigrants resembled those from the Mediterranean region, which aided them in the process of assimilating into a perception of "whiteness." In addition to having to work with clients as peddlers, many mastered the English language and learned white Americans' social norms, helping in further assimilation. At this time, nativist sentiments were on the rise.</p>
