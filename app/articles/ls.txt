   <p>In the 1890s, a community of Syrians formed on NYC’s Washington Street, called Little Syria. With nearly 2,000 Syrians living in NYC, they brought their cultures to their new settlement, with people walking in their traditional customs and eating traditional Syrian cuisines. While early immigrants were often disadvantaged and illiterate, in the 1890s, an increasing number of college-educated, literate intellectuals, educators, and journalists began to settle in NYC. In 1892, the linotype was used to print the first Arabic-language newspaper in North America, named Kawkab America. With diversity in occupation, community organizations such as the Syrian Ladies Aid Society and periodicals such as the Syrian-American Commercial Magazine also bloomed between 1890 and 1940.</p>

   <p>In the first immigration wave that ended around 1910, suppliers and peddlers were intrinsic to the community. Many produced and sold textiles; some were in the tobacco business; some ran dry goods stores. Peddling was a representation of early Syrian immigrant life, for it was not only a business of trade but also a symbol for their eventual return home. As time went on, some returned home, while others settled permanently. As the peddlers accumulated more wealth, they began to open their own businesses. According to the Syrian Business Directory, over 300 Syrian businesses had been established by 1908. They sold rugs, groceries, and various textiles.</p>
   <p>Having amassed wealth, many moved to the cheaper and cleaner Brooklyn, relying on ferries to commute between the boroughs. Leaving the next wave of immigrants to live in tenements. As immigration became stagnant with the passing of the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924, the community became scattered. Later in 1946, residents were forced to evict due to the construction of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. Later, the construction of the World Trade Center completely demolished the remaining enclave of Little Syria.</p>
