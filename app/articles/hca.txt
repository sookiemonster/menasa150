   <h3>So What is The Hart-Celler Act?</h3>
   <p>The passage of the Hart-Celler Act, also referred to as the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, was a landmark legislation for global immigration–not just MENASA peoples–to the United States. Before its enactment, the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act had established quotas limiting the number of immigrants from sending countries. However, the Hart-Celler Act abolished these racial quotas, opening the doors for immigrants from all over the world to come to America. And though it was proposed to be a bill that would, in President Lyndon B. Johnson’s own words, "not affect the lives of millions," it ultimately facilitated the migration of over one million immigrants (Waldinger, 1989) over the course of 1966 to 1979. </p>

   <h3>A Shift in New York’s Demographic Landscape</h3>
   <p>The Hart-Celler Act selected for professionals. Naturally, skilled MENASA immigrants rose to the occasion and voyaged the trip to New York. As such, the demographic landscape surrounding MENASA presence began to see a transition. Firstly, there weren’t nearly as many MENASA immigrants in New York. More importantly, however, the people coming from MENASA regions, most notably South Asia, held widely different positions when compared to the primarily homogeneous set of male professionals that came later with the passage of the bill (Khandelwal, 2018). In fact, a significant number of South Asian immigrants were originally maritime workers that left their positions to open a variety of local businesses, including restaurants and hotels, and situated themselves in Manhattan (Bald, 2007). However, with the bill extending an invitation to a specific subset of people as it did, mainly professionals and students flooded in, quickly establishing themselves within their newfound communities (Khandelwal, 2018; Hatton, 2015).</p>
   <p>Along with such an influx of people came an equally large demand for ethnic resources that had once been accessible and abundant in their home countries. As such, Hart-Celler Act’s passage demarcates a start to a new era of MENASA immigration in New York. This stage, categorized by a dramatic increase in the MENASA population and the development of ethnic communities and resources, thus encapsulates the beginning and continued growth of a significant, widespread MENASA presence throughout the city.</p>

   <h3>Expanding Outward: Effects on the National Level</h3>
   <p>The Hart-Cellar Act abolished the restrictive quota system from 1924 (the Johnson-Reed Act) and allowed for the naturalization of immigrants from Asia, opening the doors for large-scale immigration from regions that were previously excluded. This change for systematic immigrant acceptance would lead to a drastic change in the spread and influence of minority communities. While the foreign-born population in the US remains at around 12% today (around the same percentage as a century ago), there has been a significant shift in its composition. In 1900, about 80% of immigrants were from Europe, but by 2000, the European share had dropped to 16% (Foad, Hisham S. 2013). A major part of this change is due to increased immigration from the MENASA areas (the Middle East especially), with the number of immigrants from the Greater Syria region estimated to have increased more than sevenfold since 1970.</p>
   <p>MENASA immigrants arriving after the inception of the Hart-Cellar Act faced similar demographic characteristics as those in the previous major MENASA wave, but their numbers were much larger. Many left their home countries due to political instability and increased religious, ethnic, and sectarian tensions. An example being the first and second Gulf Wars, where around 53,000 Iraqis, including a significant number of Chaldean Christians, immigrated to the US (Foad, Hisham S. 2013). This trend has continued with increased migration from places like Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria to the current day.</p>

   <h3>Outward Looking In</h3>
   <p>Although Hart-Cellar eliminated the restrictive quota system from the immigration process, it did not do away with the systematic racial classification that MENASA immigrants that came from the Greater Syrian Region were Caucasian (in other words “white”) due to the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924. MENASA immigrants were still targeted by racist and xenophobic actions which was primarily due to the resentment Americans held toward the increasing competition in the labor market with immigrants, as well as the generalization of MENASA immigrants. Compared to other minority and immigrant groups, MENASA immigrants were too small a minority to garner significant national attention, therefore a guise of social and cultural ‘invisibility’ spread over the communities. </p>
   <p>A social and cultural invisibility refers to the lack of recognition and awareness of individuals and communities (in this case, of MENASA descent). Because of this lack of awareness from the country, many MENASA communities were overlooked, ignored, and marginalized, and manifested in a lack of healthcare, education, employment, and political and social representation. A textbook example of how invisibility affected the MENASA community are the Syrian communities’ confusion on identity, with five major factors encompassing the perspective:</p>
   <ol>
      <li>Self Perspective and Identity: Syrian Americans were able to dismiss a lot of the generalized xenophobic biases due to  their close parochial ties within their communities. During the “yellow race crisis” (the term “yellow race” referring to the derogatory classification of East Asian peoples, specifically Chinese immigrants during an amplified period of anti-Asian sentiment in the US), where Syrians were associated with East asian cultures that came with major xenophobic generalizations that focused on racial classification, the Syrians’ self-view had prevented them from internalizing the discrimination and prejudice they faced.</li>
      <li>Xenophobic Generalization: Often mistaken for ‘undesirable’ groups such as the Chinese, Italians or Jews and being called their respective derogatory slurs, Syrians did not struggle much with dismissing the bias they faced knowing that it was not directly aimed at them.</li>
      <li>National Dismissal: As the early MENASA community within the US was small and spread out, they did not attract significant national attention. </li>
      <li>Occupational Dispersion: An extremely common and prevalent occupation to the Syrian community was peddling. This occupation helped Syrian communities stay under the radar and not attract the same ‘undesirable’ connotation as other immigrant communities had. Peddling dispersed Syrian communities across the country and reduced their perceived threat to the American job market, as peddling was not considered to be at the same level of concern as other occupations.</li>
      <li>Religious Discrimination: The religious circumstances of Syria were complex in the 20th century and was not as predominantly Muslim as it is today. Many immigrants arriving in the States were Catholic or Jewish and were viewed under suspicion by the mainly Protestant American society, garnering anti-catholic and anti-semetic biases.</li>
