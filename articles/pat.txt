   <p>The Patriot Act, officially known as the USA PATRIOT Act (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act), was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001, in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The act aimed to strengthen national security and prevent future terrorist attacks by expanding the powers of law enforcement agencies and intelligence services but in reality, it contradicted the inclusivity with which the Bush administration was regarding itself post 9/11 (Salaita 2005). </p>
   <p>The Patriot Act allowed for increased surveillance of individuals and organizations suspected of involvement in terrorist activities, including the monitoring of electronic communications, such as emails and phone calls, without a warrant. It also allowed for the sharing of information between intelligence agencies and law enforcement, the detention of non-citizens suspected of terrorist activities, and the expansion of the use of national security letters, which allowed the government to obtain sensitive personal information without a court order. This terrified a vast majority of Arab Americans and kept them from engaging in political movements they would have otherwise been keen on supporting, such as those surrounding the Palestinian independence movement for fear of detainment (Salaita 2005). </p>
   <p>The increased surveillance and detention powers of the government led to a rise in racial profiling and discrimination against people of MENASA descent, who were unfairly targeted as potential terrorists. This was a phenomenon of “Islamoracism,” a term coined by Jaideep Singh, which essentially states that religious identity has assimilated into racial identity. In other words, people categorize certain races into certain religions, even if those being categorized do not associate with that particular religious denomination. This racial categorization was propelled by the perceived religious symbols including, but not limited to, beards, traditional South Asian garments, and religious headwear such as the turban and head-covering. In short, those that were “apparently Muslim” were targets of hate crimes post-9/11. In addition, the act made it easier for the government to deport non-citizens suspected of terrorist activities, leading to the deportation of many innocent individuals. </p>
   <p>The USA PATRIOT Act, while intended to enhance national security, has inadvertently contributed to a sense of unease and uncertainty among MENASA individuals. The act granted authorities increased surveillance and seizure powers, which raised concerns about racial and religious profiling and the erosion of civil liberties. Such an expansion of searches provided law enforcement with the ability to seize property and belongings even if it was merely for “suspected terrorism” rather than for a “reasonable probable cause.” The Council on Islamic Relations (CAIR) reported (in 2006 and 2007) that the fluctuated discrimination of law enforcement against American Muslims was a direct result of the implementation of the U.S. Patriot Act’s procedures, with many complaints stating “unreasonable arrests, detentions, search/seizures, and interrogations” (Pitt 2011). The climate of fear has resulted in heightened scrutiny, discrimination, and stigmatization of MENASA communities, particularly those perceived to fit the profile of a potential threat. This hurt the immigrants who arrived as refugees and in search of a better future for themselves and their families because they were detained and deported in massive waves despite not being offered an opportunity to challenge the evidence against them. By broadening the definition of “terrorist activities” and “material support for terrorism,” it serves to disregard numerous amendments to the U.S. Constitution, especially when it comes to addressing Muslims directly. For instance, the Act provided immigration policies the ability to regulate which nationalities could be permitted entry into the United States, a process referred to as “blacklisting” in the 1950s (Pitt 2011). Media coverage often emphasized the MENASA identity of the perpetrators, associating the entire community with the actions of a few individuals. This media portrayal reinforced existing biases and created a narrative that painted MENASA immigrants as inherently suspicious and prone to violence which contributed to the discriminatory treatment faced by MENASA communities.</p>
