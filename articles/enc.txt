         “There was nothing, no business here. Then when Indians came, and we had little resentment from some local residents, they thought the Indians are taking over and slowly, slowly the street became very popular.”

   <p>The latter version of Little India began to form in Jackson Heights near the late 1960s and early 1970s (McGowan, 2023). Before this time, the few MENASA immigrants found themselves situated in Manhattan; as such there wasn’t enough of a presence or population to warrant having such resources in such a rather remote area like Jackson Heights. However, similar to how the businesses in Curry Hill experienced a major spike in rent costs and were essentially coaxed to move to somewhere cheaper, so did MENASA residents in general. </p>
   <p>Although Little India, by its very name, is home to predominantly South Asian businesses, the area around it wasn’t–and still isn’t–exclusively Indian; because of the cheaper housing, proximity to modes of public transportation and international travel, certain areas like Jackson Heights became quite popular for a number of immigrant groups (Khandelwal, 2018; Kasinitz et al., 1998). However, with its popularity and significance, Little India became a symbol of the tangible and undeniable growing MENASA presence within New York. Like Curry Hill, Little India provided a sense of belonging and community for these immigrants. Furthermore, it established a large, outward representation of MENASA culture for others to observe, also making it an important tourist attraction and solidifying MENASA existence within the broad ethnic spectrum of New York (Kasinitz et al., 1998).</p>
   
   <h3>Flatbush Syrian Jews</h3>
   <p>Another enclave of MENASA immigrants included a significant concentration of Syrian Jews within Flatbush, Brooklyn. Prior to the Hart-Celler Act, in the 1940s, a group of them had migrated to Flatbush, eventually establishing multiple synagogues within the area (Abramovitch & Galvin, 2002). This initial creation of a receiving community and religious infrastructure proved to be an important facet of future Syrian Jew immigration. </p>
   <p>Specifically, because of the political turmoil in the sending region, Syrian Jews were banned from traveling outside the country of Israel since 1948 (United States, 1996). When the ban was later lifted in the 1990s, having that seedling of community created a pipeline for Syrian Jews, primarily from Aleppo and Damascus, to come to New York and escape the discrimination and oppression they faced back home (Friedman, 1992; United States, 1996). With that, thousands of them poured into Flatbush following the ban’s repeal, with the pre-established Syrian population openly accepting them and helping them get settled in their new environment of New York (Myers, 1992). As such, their presence started to see steady growth within the 1990s. </p>
   <p>On top of this, while many immigrant groups sought to assimilate into American culture as means of survival and avoiding discrimination, the Syrian Jews within Brooklyn as a whole stood strongly against it. In line with an Edict established in 1935 that has permeated the enclave throughout later decades, they were forbidden from marrying Jewish converts, much less non-believers; they would essentially be excommunicated otherwise (Roffe, 2006; Chafets, 2007). This emphasizes the community’s desire for a sense of cultural purity and resistance to external influences from the surrounding environment and pressures of New York. It demonstrates a unique case where the interplay of perception and presence was fairly one-sided; they didn’t allow their culture and ways of life to be affected by perception, unlike many other MENASA groups, who oftentimes were forced to adapt to such perceptions. Their presence was quite self-contained in and amongst themselves, but still would go on to highlight their undeniable place within Brooklyn, and moreover, New York. </p>
