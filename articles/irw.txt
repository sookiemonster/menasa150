   <p>The Iraq War, which began in 2003 and officially “ended” in 2011, was a highly controversial military conflict initiated by the United States and its allies. The primary reason presented to the public was the belief that Iraq possessed WMDs, which posed a significant threat to international security as well as removing Saddam Hussein from power. However, subsequent investigations found no conclusive evidence of active WMD programs in Iraq. Additionally, geopolitical factors played a role in the war, such as controlling Iraq's vast oil reserves, expanding U.S. influence in the Middle East, and shaping the region's political landscape. The Iraq War was accompanied by a massive propaganda campaign that played a crucial role in shaping public opinion and garnering support. The Bush administration selectively presented intelligence information to exaggerate the threat posed by Iraq and link it to international terrorism, specifically Al-Qaeda. The mainstream media played a significant role in disseminating the government's narrative, often portraying the war as a justifiable response to the 9/11 attacks and emphasizing the need for national security. </p>

   <p>This heavy propaganda and media coverage surrounding the Iraq War contributed to a rise in Islamophobia, perpetuating negative stereotypes about Muslims and MENASA immigrants. Muslims became scapegoats for the actions of a few extremists, leading to increased discrimination, hate crimes, and profiling. The propaganda during this era was heavily based on the dehumanization of Iraqis as a whole to manufacture consent from the wide public in an attempt to construct an excuse to wage the illegal war. President Bush’s explicit use of Saddam Hussein’s name and his use of Iraq in the context of terrorism, he implicitly announced to the majority of white American citizens that the entirety of the Arab race and all Iraqis had terror inclinations and thus it was the duty of the American government to extinguish such desires before they could be acted upon. Such fear-mongering on the part of the Bush administration developed the enemy that the state had set out to do and formed a common villain to rally against, which made manufacturing consent from the public easier to carry out. In many human societies, there is a prevailing sense of deep suspicion and fear which is reinforced by a tribal mentality that develops a fundamental division between those who belong to our group and those who are considered outsiders. Race is a significant driving factor in this dynamic relationship, as the visible differences in physical appearance, in particular, become a focal point for such intense animosity. Ultimately, people tend to exhibit the greatest hostility towards people who look significantly different (Hall 2021). By vilifying MENASA immigrant groups, Western governments shaped false and damaging perceptions that continue to have a detrimental impact on the majority of innocent individuals belonging to both. Furthermore, the conflation of the Iraq War with Islam and terrorism created a hostile environment for MENASA immigrants in the U.S. as it opened up grounds for imperative patriotism that was interlinked with xenophobia, as evidenced by the use of phrases such as “If you don’t like America, go back to where you came from,” “If you don’t agree with the United States, why don’t you just leave?,” and “A real American works hard and doesn’t complain.” This blatant racism and removal of the American identity from Arab Americans, including immigrants who have come to identify with American culture, led to the negative stereotypes surrounding the “Arab image” (Salaita 2005). The perception that MENASA immigrants posed a security threat led to further challenges in employment, housing, education, and asserting their cultural identity, hindering their social integration and acceptance within American society.</p>
